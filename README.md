# student_table
Student info and exam grades are collected

number of inputs and input format are very strict
matrix dimensions are kinda problematic xD

you can enter the titles first e.g. "name","surname","school_number","grade"
then type "data" to start entering the corresponding values
after typing "data" you will see an example
that kinda explains the way you should be entering the input
you must type in the specific format
ex: 
0 ahmet #then press enter
3 1234
2 99
1 yılmaz
    
it will be stored as [('ahmet', 'yılmaz', '1234', '99')]
the order is arranged with the help of key values
 
for now you can repeat this process for a total of 3 people
then the data will be stored and displayed
data will also be exported to a csv file
